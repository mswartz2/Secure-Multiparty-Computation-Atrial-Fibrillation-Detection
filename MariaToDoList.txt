To do list

General Python:
1. Add logger to everthing
2. Refactor preprocessing and make pickle files for it
3. Refactor feature extraction and make pickle files for it
4. Refactor graphing
5. Add something to reject record if it is too noisy
5. Shuffle data and save data folds
6. Train 10 models and save as pickle files


GNS3 Prep:
1. Get TCP communication working
2. Get HTTP communication working
3. Set up scipts with params for different experiments

GNS3:
1. Get files loaded in to docker container
2. Set up basic environment with clients, server, orchestrator
3. Run experiments
    - With original train/test data
        - Preprocessing & feature extraction at client
        - Preprocessing & feature extraction at server
    - With 10 different folds for train/test data
        - Preprocessing & feature extraction at client
        - Preprocessing & feature extraction at server

possibly Later:
1. Different noise reduction techniques
2. Improve feature extraction
